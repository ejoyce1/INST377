User Manual (docs/user_manual.md): The purpose of this document is to explain the application and its use to application’s users.


Welcome! This manual will describe how to use Collab. Collab is a system that is designed to help groups find an optimal meeting time. First, your group leader creates a group, 
and then after the group is made, all the members will sign in using the group login credentials of the group and fill out a meeting times and preferences form. 
On this form you enter your username which should be unique to you. Then you enter your group’s name that your group leader has provided to you, and then select the day of the 
week that you would prefer to meet. Then select whether you prefer to meet in the morning, which is 12:00 AM through 11:00 AM, or afternoon, which is 12:00 PM through 11:00 PM. 
Afterwards, please select whether you currently work full-time, part-time, or do not work. Next, check the days of the week that would be the worst days to meet for you, 
and finally, there is space for you to enter any comments, questions, or concerns that you may have for your group leader concerning your availability. Once all members of your 
group have entered their availability, the system will select the best time for you to meet. We hope this system will make selecting group meeting times smoother and more efficient. 

Thank you for using Collab, and enjoy!
